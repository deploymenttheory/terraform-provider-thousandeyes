// Package testlog narrates an acceptance run.
//
// An acceptance test spends most of its wall clock waiting on a live API, and a run that prints
// nothing is indistinguishable from a run that has hung. These lines are the difference between
// "it is stuck" and "it is waiting 30 seconds for consistency, as measured".

// The reason is the point. A bare sleep in a test is indistinguishable from superstition; one
