// Package types declares what an acceptance test needs to know about a resource.
//
// It is one interface, in its own package, for an import-cycle reason: the per-resource test
// helper lives in the resource's own package and implements this, while `check` and `destroy`
// consume it. If the interface lived in either of those, the resource package would import the
// checker and the checker would import the resource package.

// TestResource is how an acceptance test asks the API whether an object is really there.
//
// Every resource gets one, and it is generated rather than hand-written: the question "does
// this object exist" is answered by the resource's own read operation, which the blueprint
// already describes.
type TestResource interface {
	// Exists reports whether the object named by the state is present in the API.
	//
	// The tri-state return is the point. A nil *bool with an error means the check itself
	// failed -- a network problem, a bad token -- which is not the same as the object being
	// absent, and a test that conflated the two would report a passing destroy for an API
	// that was simply unreachable.
