// It was scaffolded once, carries no generated marker, and `emit` will not write over it
// again. Deleting it means removing `hooks.readBackPredicate` from the blueprint too, because
// the generated read-after-write calls this function when that flag is set.
//
// # Why this is not generated
//
// The generated retry asks whether the object is *readable*, which every API answers the same
// way -- a 404 means not yet. That is enough for an API whose only inconsistency is a delay
// before the object appears.
//
// It is not enough for an API that returns a *stale* object rather than a 404. There the write
// has not landed until some particular field changes, and which field that is depends on the
// API and sometimes on the resource: a modification timestamp, a revision counter, a status
// moving out of "pending". No specification states it, so it cannot be generated -- 28 of the
// reference provider's 167 resources carry a file like this and the rest do not need one.
