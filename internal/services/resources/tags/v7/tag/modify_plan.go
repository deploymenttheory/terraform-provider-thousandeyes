// This file is yours.
//
// It was scaffolded once, carries no generated marker, and `emit` will not write over it
// again -- so the drift check does not police it and your edits survive regeneration. Deleting
// it means removing `hooks.modifyPlan` from the blueprint too, because the generated resource
// asserts resource.ResourceWithModifyPlan when that flag is set.
//
// # What belongs here
//
// Plan-time judgement no specification carries. The usual cases:
//
//   - marking a resource for replacement on a change the API cannot apply in place, when
//     RequiresReplace on one attribute is too blunt because it depends on another
//   - suppressing a diff the API creates by normalising a value, which is what the probe's
//     write.normalisation fact reports
//   - enforcing a cardinality or a dependency that spans attributes in a way
//     configValidators cannot state
//
// A stub that does nothing is a perfectly good state for this file. The reference provider
// carries one in 93 of its 167 resource packages, and many are exactly that.
